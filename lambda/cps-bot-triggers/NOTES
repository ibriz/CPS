TODOs:
  - Authorize frontend
  - Authorize subscriber
  - Move lambda to s3 if >10MB
  - Test recursive_score_call with multiple pages on get_proposal_details method

LAMBDA:
  Create and upload lambda
  On the API gateway resources, create methods (GET, POST) and link to your lambda. Create resources if you need sub-url paths.
  Then deploy API.
  Copy url from dashboard
  You can view the logs in cloudwatch
  Be wary of the timeout of lambda, api gateway, ENV vars, and ram, etc
  If your lambdas are in a VPC they need to go through a NAT Gateway in order to reach external services.
    One way to achieve this is:
    configure your lambda to use a (or multiple) specific subnets (the Lambda console will suggest you associate at least 2 subnets in different availability zones to your lambda to ensure availability)
    create a NAT Gateway in a different subnet
    have the route table associated with your lambda's subnets send all outbound traffic (0.0.0.0/0) to the NAT Gateway you created (you do that by choosing the NAT in the target field)
    have the route table in the NAT's subnet send all outbound traffic to an Internet Gateway

REDIS:
  redis-cli:
    - starts interactive mode
  KEYS <pattern>:
    - KEYS * => Get all keys
  SET <key> <value>
  DEL <key1> <key2> ... <keyN>
  TYPE <key> => Get the type of the key. according to type you should use different variants of GET (GET, HGET)
    GET <key>
    HGETALL <key>
    HGET <key> <field>

  Redis on AWS:
    - Confgire from elasticCache -> redis (not from globalStore)
    - Configure NAT on the same subnet as redis
    - https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/pass-api-gateway-rest-api-parameters/
      => Same lambda to check for url path and based on that should operate differently
